8base is similar to Google Firebase in that it is serving the same need. 

That need being a Backend as a Service.

Sebastian Scholl did an excellent job of highlighting some of the differences on this blog post:\

Worth noting:

* 8base does not have the same freemium plan that Firebase gives you on the Spark plan
* 8base uses SQL DBs where Firebase uses NoSQL DBs
* 8base has built-in GraphQL engine
